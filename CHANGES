Version  0.9.3
	-  Added subdirectories for each output type as opposed to 1 directory
		containing 90,000 files.	
Version  0.9.2
	- Greatly improved OLE extraction capabilites.
Version  0.9.1
	- Re-wrote code to run on LINUX,OSX,BSD,and SOLARIS
	- Added builtin extraction functions
	- Changed default behavior to look for the conf file in /usr/local/etc as 
	  well as the the current dir.  Also the conf file is not required
	  for the program to run if the -t option is enabled.
	- Added a -i switch to specify an input file as opposed to using stdin

	  as -b to change the default block size

Version 0.69 (Our thanks to Zach Kanner for these improvements...)
	- Corrected a bug that prevented the "reverse footer search" option
	  from working correctly.
	- Added a new "NEXT" option, specify NEXT after the footer on any
          search specification line and foremost will search for 
	  the last occurence (forward only currently) of that footer in the 
          window of size length but not including that footer in the resulting 
          output file created.  This feature lets you search for files that 
          don't have good ending footers but are separated by multiple starting           footers or other identifiable data which you know should not be 
          included in the output.  This works really well for MS Word documents           where you don't know where the end is.  The start of another document
          becomes the end.  With this feature as you can specific the "NEXT" 
	  or something after the end of the data we are looking for.
	- Updated the default foremost.conf file to use the feature for .doc
	  files.  Also added tags for ScanSoft PaperPort files (.max), and
          a Windows program called PINs (.pins), which stores encrypted 
	  passwords.
Version 0.68
Version 0.67
	- Added "reverse footer search" option, specify REVERSE after the 
	  footer on any search specification line and foremost will search for
	  the last occurence of that footer in the window of size length.

Version 0.66
	- Changed normal search to Boyer-Moore algorithm. Much faster!
 	- Added progress meter
	- Added ability to suppress extensions from a single file type or 
	   from all file types.
	- Added "chop" field to show when files have been trimmed
           based on their definitions in the configuration file
	- Added "interior" field to show when files have been found 
           somewhere other than a sector boundary
	- Added OpenBSD support
	- Added Win32 support via native compilation (Mingw)
        - Added Win32 support via Cygwin, to include:
                 -using %lld instead of %Ld
                 -ignoring the fnctl line for O_LARGEFILE in Win32
                 -redeclare strsignal as const char strsignal
                 -write function basename for Win32 using '\\' as delimiter
                 -updated Makefile
	- Removed unneccessary header files from foremost.h
             
(Version 0.65 was not published)

Version 0.64 - Audit file now records full paths of input and output files
               Foremost now requires that the output directory is empty
                 before running. If necessary, foremost will create the
	         output directory (ie. if it doesn't exist)
               Added structure to internal code of foremost.c and created 
                 dig.c file

	         instead of going back to the disk every time.
	       Minor speed increase to helper functions
               Added footers for several file formats including ZIP

Version 0.62 - Added man page and make install functionality
               Added "internal" indicator to show when a file is found
                 off the start of the sector. 
               Fixed discrepancy between audit file and screen output
                regarding file numbers and offset locations (off by one)
               Added more graceful error handling

Version 0.61 - Added check for "^M" line feeds added by MSDOS editors
                 while reading configuration files.

	      (not actually released, used as test during investigation)

Version 0.3 - Code cleanup continues, moved all variables into the 
              state variable. The program still needs a LOT of work.

Version 0.2 - Code cleanup by Jesse Kornblum. Removed linux specific
              code and ported to OpenBSD. Added support for handling
              multiple images from the command line and created the
              state variable. 07 March 2001

              originally called "snarfit" 05 March 2001
